Do you want to find GIFs from your favorite anime?
Here is a website application that searches for anime GIFs of your choice. 


## How To Use

* You can search for anime gifs by clicking buttons of titles. 
* Or you can add any title of your choice in the input form to create your own button 
* Using the buttons you create, you can search your favorite anime gifs. 
* The gifs will load as still images.
* More recently searched gifs will load to the top of the section below the buttons.
* By clicking on the gifs you can start them in motion, and upon the second click the gifs will stop. 

## How It Works

The app makes AJAX calls to the Giphy API. 
JavaScript and jQuery is used to manipulate the HTML on the DOM.
