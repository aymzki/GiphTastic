# GiphTastic

A website that uses the Giphy API to search for specific gifs.


## How It Works

* You can search for anime gifs on this website by clicking buttons of titles. 
* Or you can add any title of your choice in the input form to create your own button 
* Using the buttons you create, you can search your favorite anime gifs. 
* The gifs will load as still images.
* More recently searched gifs will load to the top of the section below the buttons.
* By clicking on the gifs you can start them in motion, and upon the second click the gifs will stop.
